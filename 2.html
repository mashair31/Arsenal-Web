<p>Watch Mikel Arteta in the hot seat for the very first time, as he is presented to the media as our new head coach.<br>
The direction is going to be very clear and it's not going to be negotiable<p style="margin-top:45px;">

The direction is going to be very clear and it's not going to be negotiable<br>
Anyone not backing him is no true fan. Be apprehensive yes, maybe even worried but to not back him when he got announced about 6 hours ago is pathetic. We all want the same thing. He is going to be a great manager. please fans, don't force him out and be forced to watch him succeed elsewhere. Our fanbase is already a laughing stock please don't add to it! We need to create positivity again.
