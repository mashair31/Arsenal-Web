  <p>Follow Mikel Arteta on his first day as our new head coach, from his arrival at Arsenal Training Centre to his return to Emirates Stadium.<p style="margin-top:45px;">

  When joining us from Everton in 2011, Arteta reduced his contract demands and took a Â£10,000 pay cut to force through his dream move,<br>
  and he's now leaving pep and city where he could easily win trophies with the most expensive squad ever assembled in football to come and sort out the mess at Arsenal.<br>
  He may not be everyone's preferred choice but what's clear is that he loves Arsenal and wants to be at Arsenal and that in itself is the most important thing.<p style="margin-top:45px;">

  This should be a lesson to some of our players who are only here for the paycheck and their brands.<br>
  Playing for Arsenal should be a privilege. Only those who want to be at the club should stay and those  who feel they are too good for us should close the door on their way out.
